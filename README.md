## Description

*Brutal Design* is a generative "art" project that generates "brutalist"-inspired designs.

Now, just want to be honest: I am an engineer, a class of people that is not known for its artistic skills; I have never studied art, architecture nor design; I do somehow really really like brutalist design, but I am not an expert in it.

I started this project a long time ago (almost a year has since passed) and kind of hid it away because I am embarrassed by the idea of sharing my "creations" with the world.
However, I decided that at this point I might as well publish it, as it is a fun project that I have worked on for a while.

It started as an experiment on plane partitioning, but I decided to add some elements of nonsense-artistic-like-design to make it more interesting.
I don't really know if it works.

I think this could make a cool sticker to put on random poles around the city or a layout for a modern-confusing-artsy website. I don't know.
